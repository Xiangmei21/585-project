* Topic: Educaitonal level for adults 25+ for the US, 1970-2015.

* data source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/county-level-data-sets
Census Bureau, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 Censuses of Population, and the 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-yr average.	

1. Obtain a tidy data
we read the excel sheet "Education.xls" in R and cleaned the data into a long tidy version. Then we checked the completeness of education levels and made the level names consistent across the year. We also redirived the precentage value of each area, education level and year to check its correctness. Next we visualized the tidy data use ggplot.

2. Edulevel package
We built a package named "Edulevel" to plot and map the data. This package contains one data set and 4 functions. data set "tidy" is the cleaned data of Education levels of adults more than 25 years old in US from 1970 to 2015. Function "showcounty" returns a list of counties for a given state abbrevation, countyname can be used in "lineEd" function, "lineEd" plots all education level lines for a given county, "mapstate" function maps the "count" or "precent" data on the scale of states in US for a given education level, "mapcounty" function maps maps the "count" or "precent" data on the scale of counties for a given state and a given education level.
